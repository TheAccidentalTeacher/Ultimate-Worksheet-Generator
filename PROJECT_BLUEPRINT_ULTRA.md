# WorksheetWise: Ultra-Exhaustive Project Blueprint

---

## 0. Executive Summary

WorksheetWise is a next-generation, AI-powered worksheet and activity generator for Christian homeschoolers and educators. It is designed to be:
- The most customizable, ethical, and pedagogically sound worksheet generator available
- A platform that balances automation with human oversight, faith with academic rigor, and innovation with transparency
- A system that can be rebuilt from this document alone, with every technical, philosophical, and practical detail included

This document is intended for advanced AI agents (Claude Opus, Copilot, GPT-4, etc.) and expert developers. It is intentionally redundant, hyper-detailed, and covers every aspect of the project, including rationale, edge cases, and future extensibility.

- **Template Library**: Curated, user-contributed, and AI-generated templates, with review and approval workflow. Library includes templates for traditional academics, life skills, and specialized topics.
- **AI Integration**: Uses OpenAI, Claude, or similar for content generation, but always post-processed, checked, and labeled. AI can generate new templates, activities, and coloring prompts for any subject.
- **Professional Output Engine**: Ensures all outputs are print-ready, visually appealing, accessible, and metadata-rich. Supports both worksheet and coloring page outputs.
- **Download Utilities**: PDF, Word, HTML export, with custom branding, metadata, and accessibility tags. Coloring pages are exported as high-resolution SVG, PNG, and PDF.
- **Content Provenance**: Every output includes metadata for source, method, review status, and version.
- **Edge Cases**: Template conflicts, version mismatches, user overrides, and new subject types.

### Coloring Pages: Technical and Content Details

- **ColoringSheetGenerator Component**: Accepts parameters for theme (e.g., animals, Bible stories, prepping, firearm safety), age group, faith level, and style (whimsical, realistic, technical).
- **API Endpoint**: `/api/generate-coloring-image` accepts POST requests with parameters:
  - `theme`: e.g., "animals", "firearm safety", "hunting", "canning", "etiquette", "coding", "vibe coding", "field dressing", "prepping"
  - `ageGroup`: e.g., "elementary", "middle", "high", "adult"
  - `faithLevel`: 0-3 (for Christian integration)
  - `style`: e.g., "whimsical", "realistic", "technical"
  - `instructions`: Optional, for custom prompts
- **Image Generation**: Uses AI or curated SVG templates. For technical topics (firearm safety, prepping, etc.), includes labeled diagrams, step-by-step visuals, and safety warnings.
- **Output**: Returns SVG/PNG/PDF, with metadata for subject, theme, age group, and copyright.
- **Edge Cases**: Age-appropriate filtering, safety compliance, faith integration, and technical accuracy.

### Expanded Subjects & Life Skills (Examples)

- **Prepping & Survival**: Fire starting, water purification, shelter building, emergency kits, map reading, signaling, foraging, first aid, food storage, canning, field dressing, navigation, edible plants, weather prediction, disaster planning.
- **Firearm Safety & Training**: Parts of a firearm, safe handling, range rules, cleaning, storage, marksmanship basics, hunting safety, legal/ethical considerations, scenario-based activities, coloring pages with labeled diagrams.
- **Hunting & Field Dressing**: Animal identification, tracking, ethical hunting, field dressing steps, tool safety, game processing, preservation, wildlife conservation.
- **Canning & Food Preservation**: Sterilization, equipment, recipes, safety checks, troubleshooting, storage, nutrition, coloring pages of canning processes and tools.
- **Etiquette & Social Skills**: Table manners, introductions, thank-you notes, digital etiquette, conflict resolution, hospitality, cultural customs, role-play activities.
- **Coding & Technology**: Block coding, Python/JavaScript basics, algorithm coloring pages, hardware identification, internet safety, "vibe coding" (creative coding/art), debugging, project-based learning.
- **Other Life Skills**: Financial literacy, home maintenance, gardening, sewing, car care, time management, goal setting, emotional intelligence, leadership, teamwork, entrepreneurship.

#### For Each Expanded Subject:
- **Templates**: Each subject has modular templates for worksheets, activities, and coloring pages. Templates include step-by-step instructions, diagrams, and scenario-based questions.
- **Coloring Pages**: Technical diagrams (e.g., labeled firearm parts, canning jars, coding flowcharts), creative scenes (e.g., prepping camp, etiquette at a table), and faith-integrated visuals (e.g., stewardship, service).
- **API Support**: All subjects are supported by the worksheet and coloring page generation APIs. New subjects can be added by updating the template library and subject registry.
- **Metadata**: All outputs include subject, topic, age group, complexity, and version metadata for traceability.
- **Edge Cases**: Sensitive topics (firearms, hunting) include age-appropriate warnings, legal/ethical notes, and require user confirmation for access.

### Coding & Logic Details for AI Reproduction

- **Component Structure**: All major features (worksheet generator, coloring sheet generator, subject selectors, output engine) are implemented as modular, reusable React components with clear props and state management.
- **API Contracts**: All endpoints are documented with request/response schemas. Example:
  - `/api/generate-coloring-image` (POST): `{ theme, ageGroup, faithLevel, style, instructions }` → `{ svgUrl, pngUrl, pdfUrl, metadata }`
  - `/api/generate-worksheet` (POST): `{ grade, subject, denomination, activityTypes, ... }` → `{ title, activities, downloadUrl, metadata }`
- **Template System**: Templates are stored as JSON/YAML, with fields for subject, grade, denomination, activity type, complexity, instructions, and SVG/diagram data for coloring pages.
- **Content Engine**: Merges user input, template data, and (optionally) AI-generated content. For coloring pages, selects or generates SVGs based on theme and style, overlays labels/diagrams as needed.
- **Output Engine**: Converts worksheet and coloring page data to PDF/Word/HTML/SVG/PNG, embeds metadata, and ensures accessibility (alt text, font size, color contrast).
- **Extensibility**: New subjects, templates, and coloring themes can be added by updating the subject registry, template library, and coloring prompt list. All logic is modular and documented for AI-driven expansion.
